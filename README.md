# Code Refactor Starter Code

My first steps were to find anything broken or out of place in the site:
-fixed "search engine optimization" link in the html
-updated the title for the website

I then moved to the css file:
-consolidated the benefit-lead,-brand, and -cost to benefit-all
-consolidated the benefit-lead h3,-brand h3, and -cost h3 to benefit-all h3
-consolidated the benefit-lead img,-brand img, and -cost img to benefit-all img
-consolidated the search-engine-optimization, online-reputation-management, and social-media-marketing
into horeison-offerings# horeison

I then moved back to the html file:

I found that nearly every piece was a div and made these corrections for accessibility reasons:
-updated the header section to nav
-updated the content section to article
-updated the benefits section to aside
-updated the footer section to footer
